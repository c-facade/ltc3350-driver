Description
-----------

The LTC3350 is a backup power controller that can charge
and monitor a series stack of one to four supercapacitors.

The LTC3350 monitors system voltages, currents, stack capacitance and stack ESR which can all be read over the I2C/SMBus.
The device can trigger a SMBus alert through the SMBALERT pin.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC3350 devices, since there is no register which can be safely used to identify the chip.
You can specify the device in the device tree, or you can instatiate the device explicitly.

Example: the following will load the driver LTC3350 at address 0x09 on I2C bus #3::

  $ modprobe ltc3350
  $ echo ltc3350 0x09 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-2/new_device

This is assuming that i2c numbering starts from zero.

Sysfs entries

TODO describe the system and the sysfs entries.
