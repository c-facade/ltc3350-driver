ltc3350: Linear Technology LTC3350 High Current Supercapacitor Backup Controller and System Monitor

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "ltc3350"
- reg: I2C address

Optional properties:
 - capacitor-overvoltage-level:
		This is an alarm threshold for each individual capacitor in the stack. The value is expressed in 185 microvolts per LSB.
 - esr-high-level:
		This is an alarm threshold for the measured stack ESR. It is expressed as RSNSC/64 per LSB.
 - capacitance-low-level:
		This is an alarm threshold for measured stack capacitance. It is expressed as 336µF • RT/RTST per LSB for large value capacitor stacks.
 - cap-esr-measurement-period
		This sets the period for repeated ESR and capacitance measurements. Each unit corresponds to 10 seconds. If not specified, periodic measurements will be disabled.
 - cap-esr-initial-measurements:
		The number of measurements after initial power-up. If not specified, there will be *insert number* every *hour?*. If zero, initial measurements will be disabled.

If a threshold is unset, the corresponding alert will be disabled.

In order to receive SMBUS alerts, CONFIG_I2C_SMBUS and CONFIG_OF modules must be enabled. The parent I2C device node must declare the 'smbus_alert' interrupt on the appropriate interrupt line.

Example:

&i2c3 {
	/* i2c properties */
	interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 37 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		<&gpio1 10 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	interrupt-names = "irq", "smbus_alert";

	ltc3350: ltc3350@09 {
		compatible = "ltc3350";
		reg = <0x09>;

		capacitor-overvoltage-level = <12534>; // 2300 mV
		maximum-temperature = <12907>; // 110 C
		esr-high-level = <192>; // 15 mR
		capacitance-low-level = <249>; // 60 F
		cap-esr-measurement-period = <12>;
		cap-esr-initial-measurements = <10>;
	}
};
