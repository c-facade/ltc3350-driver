  The I2C SMBus port allows communication, and the SMBALERT pin allows the use of the SMBus alert response protocol.
  In order to receive SMBus alerts, CONFIG_I2C_SMBUS and CONFIG_OF modules must be enabled. The parent I2C device node must declare the 'smbus_alert' interrupt on the appropriate interrupt line.

  If a threshold is unset, the corresponding alert will be disabled.

	capacitor-overvoltage-level:
		description:
			This is an alarm threshold for each individual capacitor in the stack. The value is expressed in 185 microvolts per LSB.
  max-temperature:
    description:
      This is an alarm threshold for the die temperature. It is expressed as Temperature = 0.028°C per LSB – 251.4°C.
	esr-high-level:
		description:
			This is an alarm threshold for the measured stack ESR. It is expressed as RSNSC/64 per LSB.
	capacitance-low-level:
		description:
			This is an alarm threshold for measured stack capacitance. It is expressed as 336µF • RT/RTST per LSB for large value capacitor stacks.
	cap-esr-measurement-period:
		description:
			This sets the period for repeated ESR and capacitance measurements. Each unit corresponds to 10 seconds. If not specified, periodic measurements will be disabled.
	cap-esr-initial-measurements:
		description:
			The number of measurements after initial power-up. If not specified, there will be one test per hour for 72 hours. If zero, initial measurements will be disabled.
    default:
      72
